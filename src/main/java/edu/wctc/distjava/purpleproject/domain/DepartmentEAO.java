/**
 * This class is a Stateless EJB. We need an EJB because we want the methods
 * to be transactional and the EJB Container provides Container Managed
 * Transactions automatically (less code for us to write!). Alternatively
 * we could use Spring and let Spring manage the transactions, or we could
 * write them ourselves (uugh!).
 * <P>
 * Why a "Stateless" EJB? Because this class simply provides data to other
 * objects. No need to store anything long-term here. And stateless EJBs 
 * are much more performant and memory efficient than "Statfull" EJBs.
 * <P>
 * One more thing. JEE v6+ allows the creation of EJBs without first
 * declaring local or remote (or both) interfaces (see the JEE tutorial). This
 * is a convenience for us programmers, but it also means that this EJB is
 * a "Local" EJB and we cannot make this remotely accessible, which has benefits 
 * in certain situations. For example, imagine a service that runs on a server 
 * other than the one where this application is running. With a Remote EJB we
 * could access that service from this application which is running on a
 * different server. We could also cluster a group of servers to run a bunch
 * of remote EJBs, allowing for great scalability. But none of that can 
 * happen when we use a local EJB. Declaring the way we have makes this the
 * only option.
