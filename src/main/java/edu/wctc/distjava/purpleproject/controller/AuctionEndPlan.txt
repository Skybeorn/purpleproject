Plan for handling auction end
-----------------------------

Option #1
---------
Write a small, standalone app that queries the database at launch time and 
makes a list of pending items that will be ending soon. Sort the list in
reverse chronological order, and start a countdown thread for the first to
expire item. Have that thread execute a post-item-end method to notify the
winner. This could also be done as a smart-phone app.

Option #2
---------
Same as above but use EJB timers.

Create an automatic timer that runs a method at the start of each day. 

That method will make a list of all auction items that will expire on that day 
and store them sorted in reverse chronological order, with the first to expire 
at the top of the list.

Next, a programmatic timer will be created for each item expiring item. The
timers are set to timeout precisely at the auction end date/time. The
method annotated with @Timeout will then be called when each timer expires.
This method will cause an email to be sent to the winner and to update the
database log_action with this info.
