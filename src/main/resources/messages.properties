# Base Resource File
#
# Properties files just store key=value pairs and can be used
# for a variety of purposes, including dependency injection (DI). However,
# in a web application these files are primarily used for internationalization
# of text in the view pages. The term "i18n" is an abbreviation for
# "internationalization" ... begin with the letter "i" followed by 18 more
# characters, ending in the letter "n". Note you must configure these
# properties files in the /WEB-INF/faces-config.xml file. For i18n you need
# a default properties file (this one) and separate copies for each
# supported language. These language files are appended with a language code,
# e.g., i18n_en_US.properties, where "_en_US" is the extended form.
#
# IMPORTANT: no dots or spaces can be used as separators in keys; use only
# the underscore character.
